# We can use the type() function to know which class a variable or a value belongs
# to and isinstance() function to check if it belongs to a particular class

a = 5

# Output: <class 'int'>
print(type(a))

# Output: <class 'float'>
print(type(5.0))

# Output: (8+3j)
c = 5 + 3j
print(c + 3)

# Output: True
print(isinstance(c, complex))
print(isinstance(c, int))
print(isinstance(a, int))

#wWAP to create a list of differrent number,(int, float, complex)
# from the above list, filter all the int move them all into int list
# from the above list, filter all the float move them all into int float
# from the above list, filter all the complex move them all into int complex
